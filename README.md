# GSLab Make Library

Overview
--------
This repository contains the `gslab_make` Python library. 

Information about this package is available in its internal documentation. 

Requirements
------------
- Python 2.7 
- `setuptools` ([installation instructions](https://packaging.python.org/installing/))
- `mock` (> 2.0.0) and `coverage` in order to run the unit tests 

Installation
------------

The preferred installation method is to use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/gentzkow/gslab_make.git@master
```
or
```
pip install git+https://git@github.com/gentzkow/gslab_make.git@master
```
which are the SSH and HTTPS protocol versions, respectively.

The package at any tagged release, branch, or commit can be installed with the same commands, just changing `master` to the desired target; e.g., 
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/gentzkow/gslab_make.git@<tag, branch name, or commit hash>
```


Note that this installation procedure may require obtaining machine privileges through,
say, a `sudo` command.


Alternatively, one may install the local version of `gslab_make` by running (from the root of the repository)

```
pip install .
```

We do not recommend that these packages be installed by executing
```bash
python setup.py install
```
This method of installation uses egg files rather than wheels, which can cause conflicts with previous versions of `gslab_tools`. If this method of installation is executed, some files need to be removed from the directory with a `clean` argument. `clean` removes `/build`,`/dist`, and `GSLab_Make.egg-info`, which are built upon installation. This argument can be called by executing 

```bash
python setup.py clean
```


Testing
-------

We recommend that users use [coverage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/) 
to run this repository's unit tests. Upon installing coverage (this can be done with
pip using the command `pip install coverage`), one may test `gslab_make`'s contents
and then produce a code coverage report the commands:

```bash
python setup.py test [--include=<paths>]
```

Here, the optional `--include=` argument specifies the files whose test results
should be included in the coverage report produced by the command. 
It works as `coverage`'s argument of the same name does. The command should be
run without this option before committing to `gslab_make`.

FAQs
-------

Q: What if I want to install a different branch called `dev` of `gslab_make` rather than `master`?

A: Either `git checkout dev` that branch of the repo before installing, or change `@master` to `@dev` in the `pip install` instruction.
